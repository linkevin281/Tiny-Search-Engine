Test with null counters and bad key

Count (should be zero): 0

Testing counters_add...
Input key integers: 
The key's counter is: 1
The key's counter is: 1
The key's counter is: 2
The key's counter is: 1
The key's counter is: 2
The key's counter is: 3
The key's counter is: 1

The key's counter is: 4
The key's counter is: 0
The key's counter is: 0
The key's counter is: 0
The key's counter is: 0

Testing counters_print, The counters:
{4=4,3=3,2=2,1=1,}
Should Print: {4=4,3=3,2=2,1=1,}

Testing counters_get...
Input key integer: 
Key is: 1, Count is: 1
Key is: 2, Count is: 2
Key is: 3, Count is: 3
Key is: 4, Count is: 4
Testing nonexisting key, expected = 0
Key is: 5, Count is: 0
Testing negative key, expected = 0
Key is: -5, Count is: 0

Testing counters_set...
Input key integer: 
Testing basic set 
Key is: 1, Count is: 1
Testing negative (fail) set 
Key is: 2, Count is: 0
Testing 0 set 
Key is: 3, Count is: 1
Testing new key set 
Key is: 5, Count is: 1
Testing negative key (fail)
Key is: -5, Count is: 0

The counters: (key=counter)
{5=5,4=4,3=0,2=2,1=10,}
Should be: {5=5,4=4,3=0,2=2,1=10,}

delete the counters...
