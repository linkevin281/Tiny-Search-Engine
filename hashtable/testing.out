Inserted one,one
Inserted two,two
Inserted three,three
Inserted one,existing (should fail because key is duplicate)
Inserted existing,one (should succeed with duplicate value)
Testing hashtable_print
The hashtable:
{}{}{(two, two),}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{(three, three),}{(existing, one),}{}{}{}{(one, one),}{}
Expected: 
{}{}{(two, two),}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{(three, three),}{(existing, one),}{}{}{}{(one, one),}{}

Testing hashtable_iterate
These two values should be equal: 4 = 4

Testing hashtable_find...
For key [three]: three = three
For key [existing]: one = one
For key [dne]: (null) = (null)
Null hashtable: (null) = (null)
Null key: (null) = (null)
Input key: 
Key is: (null), Item is: (null)

delete the hashtable...
